                <figcaption>Professional Stock Photography</figcaption>
                I help create original stock photography, including photographs that are designed to be eye-popping and help increase clicks. As I have shown below, this is a picture from a clothing shop in Bridgewater, New Jersey. I take pictures of designs I find interesting and public places in Somerset, Hunterdon, and Morris Counties in New Jersey.

                We provide materials in Spanish as a second language, the second most spoken language in the United States, as well as the top language in much of Latin America and Spain. I use a combination of my own personal knowledge that I picked up from my classes in school and elsewhere, and one of my employees who is a native speaker, to help deliver Spanish-language versions of websites when necessary.

            <div class="rating">4.5 out of 5</div>
            <div class="content">I am very grateful to have the stock photography provided to me by Alex Diaz and his IDMX 225 crew. The pictures were about 10 megapixels, even better than what I needed for my Website (but I shrunk the pictures for the publishing end). It made my website feel more connected to other people because it helped others understand what kinds of experiences I am promoting.</div>

            <div class="content">I am very grateful to have had Alex's help on my website! He really knows his business. I met with him in his office and he answered all my questions even though sometimes his crew did indeed help him out with it. I was very happy to see him in person, and I was thrilled to meet him.</div>

            <div class="content">Thank you for helping translate my website into Spanish to allow for a more diverse audience from different countries. I run a photo display company, and I wanted to be able to advertise my services to customers in Latin America. While it took longer than I would have liked, the team still got the job done.</div>
